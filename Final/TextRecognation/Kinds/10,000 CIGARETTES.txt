the apres dinner cigarette.
GLORIA 3

A L E X  B R O U N  7
GLORIA 3
ciggie,
GLORIA 1
smoke. I prefer to call them by their full name –

cigarette.
GLORIA 3
Derived from the fact that it is a smaller version of its antecedent –
GLORIA 2
Anti – who?
GLORIA 3
Cedent.
GLORIA 4
Ancestor.
GLORIA 2
Which was?
GLORIA 1
The cigar.
GLORIA 4
But whereas cigars are
GLORIA 1
big,
GLORIA 2
heavy
GLORIA 3
awkward.
GLORIA 4
The cigarette is –

GLORIA 1
dainty,

elegant,

GLORIA 4
Inhalation
GLORIA 2

An awakening of

Spirit

GLORIA 3
Awareness.
GLORIA 2
Lungs
GLORIA 1
An Epiphany. I used to hide around the corner and watch him
GLORIA 2
Standing on the verandah,
GLORIA 3
Leaning in the doorway,
GLORIA 4
Hair slicked back –
GLORIA 1
Dark blue singlet
GLORIA 2
And gripped in his
GLORIA 3
Strong tanned fingers
GLORIA 4
The constant flickering glow.
GLORIA 1
I pinched one of his

GLORIA 4
on the kitchen table
1 0 , 0 0 0  C I G A R E T T E S  10

Lit it on the stove

Between coughs
GLORIA 1
I had discovered a secret

GLORIA 4
lover
GLORIA 3
God.
[BEAT.]
GLORIA 1
You can also just call them by their brand.
GLORIA 4
That is also acceptable,
GLORIA 2
As in?
GLORIA 1
“Hand me a Lucky Strike.”
GLORIA 3
“Care for a Dunhill.”
A L E X  B R O U N  11
GLORIA 2
“Got any Camels.”
GLORIA 4
“Would you care to share a Citane?”
GLORIA 1
Which brings us to another of the great attractions of cigarettes.
GLORIA 3
Their international –
GLORIA 2
flavour.
GLORIA 1
Cigarettes from all over the world –

many of which I have tried

sunglasses,
GLORIA 4
Dior from head to toe.
GLORIA 3
To die for.
GLORIA 4
“One packet of Yves Saint Laurent. Merci. ”
GLORIA 1
Which brings me to another of my favourite things – the cigarette fantasy.
GLORIA 2
I’ve got a cigarette fantasy! I smoke ten thousand cigarettes – all at once.
GLORIA 4
Simultaneously?
GLORIA 2
No. One after the other. Now I know that sounds like a lot of cigarettes but
actually - look at this.
[GLORIA 2 TAKES OUT A PACKET OF CIGARETTES AND
PLACES THEM ON THE FLOOR.]
GLORIA 2
Now that is twenty five cigarettes –
GLORIA 3
A quarter of a century –
GLORIA 2
Not very big is it ? In fact it’s tiny. So you times that by four, you get …
1 0 , 0 0 0  C I G A R E T T E S  16
GLORIA 3
one hundred.
GLORIA 2
[INDICATING SIZE WITH HANDS]
Still quite small. Times that by 10
GLORIA 3
One thousand.
GLORIA 2
Still not a lot and then by ten again –
GLORIA 3
Ten thousand!
GLORIA 2
By ten!
GLORIA 3
One hundred thousand!
GLORIA 2
By ten!
GLORIA 3
One million cigarettes!
[PAUSE.]
GLORIA 1
In this fantasy I am in the most luxurious palace.
GLORIA 4
Silver and gold
GLORIA 3
Heavy oak furniture,
GLORIA 1
polished marble floors,
GLORIA 2
high ceilings,
A L E X  B R O U N  17
GLORIA 4
tall windows,
GLORIA 3
framed portraits.
GLORIA 1
History,
GLORIA 2
majesty,
GLORIA 4
class.
GLORIA 1
This house is not my house –
GLORIA 4
it is the fabled Shrangri-la of cigarette lovers
GLORIA 3
across the globe.
GLORIA 2
The Palace of Cigarettes.
GLORIA 4
Le Palais de Cigarette.
GLORIA 3
Cigarette heaven.
GLORIA 1
Once I enter Le Palais de Cigarette, a butler –
GLORIA 3
very regal,
GLORIA 2
English accent –
1 0 , 0 0 0  C I G A R E T T E S  18
GLORIA 3
with a voice that sounds like vintage port meets -
GLORIA 2
Golden syrup.
GLORIA 1
Greets me.
GLORIA 4
“Good evening Ma’m.”
GLORIA 1
He bears an engraved silver tray
GLORIA 3
and on the tray is
GLORIA 2
one lone cigarette
GLORIA 1
and a silver lighter.
GLORIA 3
Silver -
GLORIA 2
Not gold.
GLORIA 1
Stylish -
GLORIA 4
Not ostentatious.
GLORIA 1
Now at first I’m a little less than pleased by this.
GLORIA 2
“One cigarette – is that it ?”
A L E X  B R O U N  19
GLORIA 3
But I have no need to worry.
GLORIA 1
I light up my cigarette and he leads me up an ornate staircase
GLORIA 4
“To a hall which opens on to hundreds and hundreds of rooms”
GLORIA 1
The hall seems to go on and on – forever.
GLORIA 2
He leads me towards a door.
GLORIA 4
I knock on the solid heavy timber
GLORIA 3
And in a second the door is opened
GLORIA 1
and I’m confronted by
GLORIA 2
“A cowboy in leather boots and a red check shirt.”
GLORIA 1
He takes me in to the room which is
GLORIA 2
“An old style Wild West Saloon”
GLORIA 1
and sits me down at a battered wooden table.
GLORIA 3
He pours me a shot of –
GLORIA 2
“Makers Mark.”
1 0 , 0 0 0  C I G A R E T T E S  20
GLORIA 1
and he pulls out a dusty packet of
GLORIA 4
Marlboro’s
GLORIA 2
“tucked underneath his bootstrap.”
GLORIA 1
He offers me one and lights it
GLORIA 2
“With a wax tipped match.”
GLORIA 1
We sit and drink and smoke and chat about his life and times and then
GLORIA 3
before I know it
GLORIA 1
I’m back in the hall,
GLORIA 2
Butler by my side.
GLORIA 4
“This way Ma’m.”
GLORIA 2
Then I’m knocking on another door and I’m back stage –
GLORIA 4
At the Moulon Rouge
GLORIA 3
Surrounded by hundreds of gorgeous showgirls
GLORIA 2
In the most incredible costumes.
A L E X  B R O U N  21
GLORIA 1
We huddle in the corner of their cramped dressing room,
GLORIA 4
Puffing on Gauloises,
GLORIA 3
Giggling
GLORIA 2
And gossiping
GLORIA 4
About the glamour of the stage
GLORIA 1
And the mysterious stranger who always sits at the back table,
GLORIA 3
face half covered in shadow,
GLORIA 2
who is rumoured to be
GLORIA 4
a very wealthy Crown Prince
GLORIA 3
with an eye on one of the showgirls.
GLORIA 1
“Me!”
GLORIA 2
“No me!”
GLORIA 3
“No me!’
GLORIA 4
“No – me.”
1 0 , 0 0 0  C I G A R E T T E S  22
GLORIA 1
Now I’m on the set of a
GLORIA 2
Fellini movie
GLORIA 4
with the most beautiful woman of all time –
GLORIA 3
“Claudia Cardinale”
GLORIA 2
In my humble opinion.
GLORIA 1
We’re in her dressing room
GLORIA 3
“Smoking a Zenit Triplo”
GLORIA 1
And I’m trying to console her,
GLORIA 4
“Forget Federico’s wild moods”
GLORIA 2
“Trust in your own gift”
GLORIA 1
“Your pure talent, your – “
GLORIA 3
“Magnificent beauty”.
GLORIA 1
Another room and I’m in
GLORIA 4
“Moscow. The day before the October revolution”
A L E X  B R O U N  23
GLORIA 1
Sitting across the table from
GLORIA 4
“Vladimir Ilich Lenin”
GLORIA 1
With a Stolichnye in hand –
GLORIA 4
“The cigarette not the vodka”
GLORIA 1
plotting the Tsar’s downfall.
GLORIA 3
In another room
GLORIA 2
There’s the whole of the Sydney Cricket Ground.
GLORIA 1
I’m in the Aussies dressing room sharing a
GLORIA 2
“Stuyvo with Warnie.”
GLORIA 1
Then Adam Gilchrist says:
GLORIA 3
“Hey, you’re not allowed to smoke in here”
GLORIA 2
“Wuss!”
GLORIA 1
Warnie just laughs and hands me another. Next I’m in a -

GLORIA 1
Every room
GLORIA 2
Another destination,
GLORIA 3
Another time,
GLORIA 4
Another magical companion –
GLORIA 1
All linked by our universal passion –
GLORIA 2
the greatest invention of all time –
GLORIA 3
the glue that holds mankind –
GLORIA 4
and womankind
GLORIA 3
together.

[SILENCE. GLORIA 3 COUGHS. PAUSE. SHE COUGHS AGAIN.]
GLORIA 4
Or should that be Mausoleum?
[BEAT.]
GLORIA 2
They had a brand of cigarettes called “Death” once didn’t they ?
GLORIA 3
Yeah. It was cool.
GLORIA 1
It was in a black packet with like skull and cross bones.
GLORIA 2
Brilliant!
GLORIA 4
We loved it.
GLORIA 1
Pity the cigarettes inside were so crap.
[THEY ALL NOD IN AGREEMENT.]
GLORIA 2
Death cigarettes. Pretty ironic huh?
[GLORIA 2 LAUGHS. THE OTHERS TURN TO LOOK AT HER.
GLORIA 2 STOPS LAUGHING.]
GLORIA 1
Non-smokers think the danger aspect of smoking is a real turn off.
1 0 , 0 0 0  C I G A R E T T E S  26
ALL
Wrong !
GLORIA 3
Smokers love the danger.
GLORIA 4
Cheating the grim reaper,
GLORIA 1
They put their pathetic warnings on cigarette boxes,
GLORIA 2
Spend all this money on tacky adds,
GLORIA 3
Offer us nicotine patches,
GLORIA 4
how to quit classes,
GLORIA 1
breakthrough weekends,
GLORIA 2
spiritual healing.
GLORIA 3
Wrong!
GLORIA 4
Wrong!
GLORIA 1
Wrong! Don’t you understand if we wanted to stop smoking we would.
GLORIA 2
I will give up.
GLORIA 3
Just not today.
A L E X  B R O U N  27
GLORIA 4
Like that poet once said: Those something somethings –
GLORIA 3
“half in love with easeful death”.
GLORIA 2
He was talking about smokers
GLORIA 4
Because we recognise that in the end life is
GLORIA 2
Fleeting,
GLORIA 3
transient,
GLORIA 1
momentary
GLORIA 4
and trying to hold on to it is like
GLORIA 3
trying to catch smoke
GLORIA 4
in the palm of your hand.
GLORIA 1
Or maybe we just like smoking too much to give a damn.
[GLORIA 3 COUGHS AGAIN. THEY ALL TURN TO LOOK AT
HER.]
GLORIA 3
Sorry.
GLORIA 2
I think they should start up a Cigarette smokers Hall of Fame.
GLORIA 1
Entry only available for those who have smoked
1 0 , 0 0 0  C I G A R E T T E S  28

[GLORIA 4 COUGHS. THEY ALL TURN TO LOOK AT HER.]
GLORIA 4
Sorry.
GLORIA 2
Now you might think that is impossible but I worked it out. If you started
(COUGHS) at say 14 years of age and you smoked a (COUGHS) and a half a day
– not that hard, I do that occasionally – you’d be ready for the Hall of (COUGH)
by the time you were (COUGH). Now that would be a (COUGH). I wonder if
anybody’s (COUGH COUGH). Maybe I could be the (COUGH). The very first to
enter the (COUGH COUGH COUGH)
GLORIA 1
Maybe you should reduce the number –
GLORIA 2
500,000 …
GLORIA 4
100,000 …
GLORIA 3
50,000 …
[GLORIA 1 COUGHS.]
GLORIA 2
10,000.
GLORIA 3
[TO GLORIA 2]
You sounded just like …
GLORIA 4:
Dad.
[PAUSE.]
GLORIA 1
He lay on a hospital bed for two months coughing just like that. Still didn’t stop.
He’d sit out on the verandah,
A L E X  B R O U N  29
GLORIA 2
Of the hospital ,
GLORIA 1
In a wheel chair, smoke pouring out of the little plastic hole they dug in to his
throat. Doctors had given up trying to make him quit. What was the point ? Right
to the very end, died with the
ALL
Constant flickering glow
GLORIA 2
Of a Kent
GLORIA 1
in his filthy yellow fingers. Still wearing that stupid blue singlet. He was 47. Wife
and four daughters –
GLORIA 2
who

all
GLORIA 4
smoke.
GLORIA 2
Nice funeral.
GLORIA 3
Not really.

What you need to understand is the trick isn’t stopping – it’s not starting in the
